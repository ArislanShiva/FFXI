### Gearswap files

Job luas are modified from [Mote's job files](https://github.com/Kinematics/GearSwap-Jobs) -- he definitely deserves a ton of credit for not only the luas, but his awesome gearswap libraries.

If you're new to Mote's, I highly recommend reading the [Kinematics wiki](https://github.com/Kinematics/GearSwap-Jobs/wiki) to find out how all the core functions and logic work.

Feel free to use and modify to your hearts' content.  If you redistribute/share, I only ask that you give credit to Mote.
